          Like all learning problems, difficulties in writing can be devastating
          to a childs education and self-esteem. As children progress through
          school, they are increasingly expected to express what they know about
          many different subjects through writing. If a child fails to develop
          certain basic skills, he will be unable to write with the speed and
          fluency required to excel as these demands increase. Indeed, for a
          child struggling with a writing problem, the writing process itself
          interferes with learning. Students faced with such difficult odds have
          trouble staying motivated.
